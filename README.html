<h1 id="chip8-interpreter">CHIP8 interpreter</h1>
<p>An interpreter for the CHIP-8 programming language written in C.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-run">How to run</h2>
<p>Compile program with:</p>
<p><code>make</code></p>
<p>Then run the <code>chip8</code> executable with at least two arguments:</p>
<p><code>./chip8 &lt;filename&gt; &lt;scale factor&gt; [&lt;debug mode&gt;]</code></p>
<p>The <code>&lt;debug mode&gt;</code> argument is optional. When a third argument is provided, the interpreter runs in debug mode that prints to standard output the state of the registers and the instruction code to run, at the begining of each processor cycle.</p>
<p>This repository provides a <code>roms</code> directory with CHIP-8 programs, see its README to get a list of the ones that can be executed with this interpreter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> If you want to run other ROMs, make sure they contain only the program part and not another interpreter, as this interpreter loads the ROM file content at address <code>0x0200</code> in RAM.</p>
